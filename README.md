## What is 'Deathrattle'?
An extreme private way of maintaining your intension after you are dead. It is running on AWS serverless or any decentralized networks. You have to know how to code in order to use it. (if you let someone do it for you, it is not private anymore, isn't it?)

### How does it determine that you are dead?
Most of the process is automated. You can forget once you run this service.
1. detect the absent of your digital footprints/behaviors
    1. check email
    2. login/post social media
2. derive from your wearables
    1. check your heartrate on a critical session
3. derive from your smarthome/IoT devices

### What digital actions your could execute?
Nowadays, I do not see any actions not possible with 'deathrattle' since digital actions become inseperable from physical ones.
1. make a call to someone on this planet
2. pay someone a money
3. reveal a fact or testament to the world
4. send a gift to your child every his birthday
5. control your IoT devices
6. sell your stocks in portfolio
7. say how much you love your significant one.

### How does it maintain itself?
* You have to create a test yourself. To ensure, the completeness of its executions
* For AWS, you have to get a special credit card that still works after your death
* For Ethereum, you have to have a sufficient enough of gas to run your application througtout.
* Your have to create a way to update the actions.
